# coding_quiz

## Description 
In this project I created a quiz app to test teh user on various computer programming techniques and conventions. There is a timer that starts when you start the game, and each incorrect answer results in a time penalty. once you finish you have the ability to submit your time with your initials, and view all highscores that have been logged to the game. You have the ability to replay it as many times as you want.
